I have built the game assigned by the odin project (rock paper scissor)   
It is intended to be played from the browsers (chrome) console, that is the only reason the index file exists (sine you need a webpage and a empty one makes everything easier)
and all of the important code is in script.js with some comments which might help you undestand my thought process
Now i will continue with the next section called clean code
